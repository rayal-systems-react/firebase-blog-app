            An 'About Us' page is a spot for your founding story, a place to
            show off your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most
            pressing question new customers have about your business. What an
            'About Us' page should be is a goal-oriented sales page, one that
            focuses on highlighting the biggest selling points of your story and
            brand at the top of the page, making a strong first impression on
            curious customers In Shopify’s customer trust research, we found
            that shoppers navigate to an About Us page to learn more about the
            brand and the people behind the products. Your 'About Page' should
            address those two curiosities shoppers have to help with decision
            making. Shoppers are also interested in a company’s mission. They’ll
            use the About Us page to determine if they share core values with
            the business and to decide if they want to shop with the business or
            not. In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page is the ideal
            place to accommodate a number of objectives: Communicate the story
            of your business and why you started it. Describe the customers or
            the cause that your business serves. Explain your business model or
            how your products are made. Put a face to your business, featuring
            the founders or the people on your team. Incorporate persuasive
            content (e.g., an explainer video, data visualizations, links to
            blog posts) that might otherwise clutter your homepage. Your 'About
            Us' page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t
            borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure
            and design. The following are examples of different ways you can
            tackle your About Us page design.
